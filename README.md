[One Thing](https://sindresorhus.com/one-thing) app extensions. It is a set of extensions that transforms the One thing app into a powerful widget inside your Ô£ø Mac's menu bar. 

The idea of the One Thing app is to put a single task or goal in your menu bar. Our goal is to extend the One Thing app with everything you can imagine and can fit into one line of text. It can be the next meeting on your calendar or cryptocurrency price or the weather in your city. Everything that you wanna constantly see in the menu bar.

Requires `node-js` and [One Thing](https://sindresorhus.com/one-thing) app to be installed.
